            <b>Object Oriented Design</b>
            <br>
            Even though I enjoyed my time taking OOD, I had a hard time with
            the layout of the class.  I do think that I learned the most in this
            class than all of my other classes combined.  Also, people were not 
            underestimating how long it takes to complete homeworks. We had two 
            major project homeworks, both games, called SoloRed and Three-Trios.
            SoloRed INSERT LINK was very difficult for me, I wasn't used to having 
            such a large codebase with so many classes.  Once I got in that groove, 
            Three-Trios was less difficult in that aspect, but more difficult in 
            design.  Overall I learned a lot and the course was beneficial to take, 
            I was able to learn more about design rather than programming, hence 
            the name of the course, but it was good and I enjoyed it much more 
            than fundies 1 and 2.

                <b>Linear Algebra</b>
                <br>
                Linear Algebra was unlike any other math class I've taken at Northeastern.
                My professor was very unconventional, which wasn't favorable at first, but 
                he soon became one of my favorite profs of all time.  His motivation for 
                teaching was to really pound down the fundamentals of linear algebra into His
                students, which was exactly why I took the class !!  Most my profs at NEU have
                mostly been teaching to do research, which was exemplified through their 
                commitment to their students, but linear algebra was different.  I messed up 
                one of my midterms really bad, it was the worst i've done in an exam ever.  I 
                went to him ready to bargain for my grade and he accepted it with open arms.  
                I was able to work on my grade by doing extra study sessions, homeworks, and even 
                a mercy exam at the end of the semester.  He really showed me what can happen when
                you have a professor that cares for teaching, and it was refreshing to see.

            <b> Fundamentals of Data Science</b>
            <br>
            My first exposure to data science, and python as a whole, was this course.  It was 
            my professors first semester teaching and it felt like we were learning together, in the 
            most positive way.  I felt comfortable making mistakes because he sometimes made mistakes 
            too, and this guy had a PHD.  My homeworks also felt more satisfying than in my CS classes 
            because in a way the results were more instantanious.  I was solving practical problems with
            practical solutions, very different from building games for design purposes.  My final project
            was building machine learning polynomial regression models for a google trends dataset 
            for health fads, predicting the length of popularity of said trends based off the previous 
            frequency and popularity.  I enjoyed the experience of cleaning and visualizing data, and 
            building regression models, which was a nice taste of what data science has to offer.
