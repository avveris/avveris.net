                    <b>The Reasoning Behind This Paper</b>
                    I wrote this paper for a class I took Spring 2023 called Science Technology and Public Policy according to 
                    the given prompt: "Take a Science & Technology related policy issue and explain how its discourse has evolved using the 
                    analytical framework of framing discussed by Nisbet. Notice that framing is an explanatory framework, so you would 
                    essentially be discussing how and why a particular science and technology policy discourse has evolved the way it has.". 
                    I remember net neutrality being a discussion around 2018, but at the time I didn't know or care how it would change
                    the internet as long as I was still able to use it as I had previously. Looking into the corruption behind the decision making
                    for passing net neutrality was enlightening to say the least.
