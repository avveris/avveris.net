            Hi! I'm Avery Darlington and I am a beginner programmer. 
            I'm an undergraduate student at <I>Northeastern University</I> pursuing a 
            major in Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently 
            searching for a co-op for July 2025-January 2026. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have experience coding with Java, Python, Javascript, Shell, HTML, and CSS-- 
            but I am always looking to learn more.  My favorite coding environments are Visual Studio
            Code and IntelliJ, but I have worked in Eclipse as well.  Most of my python experience is 
            for data purposes, so I have worked with libraries such as NumpPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, etc.  

            <br>
