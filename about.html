                Hi! I'm Avery Darlington and I am a beginner programmer. 
                I'm an undergraduate student at <i>Northeastern University</i> pursuing a 
                major in Cybersecurity and a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently 
                searching for a co-op for July 2025-January 2026.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I have experience coding with Java, Python, Javascript, Shell, HTML, and CSS-- 
                but I am always looking to learn more. My favorite coding environments are Visual Studio
                Code and IntelliJ, but I have worked in Eclipse as well. Most of my python experience is 
                for data purposes, so I have worked with libraries such as NumpPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, etc.

                <u>Some of my academic interests include:</u><br>
                <i>Mathematics~</i> Statistics + Linear Algebra.<br>
                <i>Psychology~</i> Social engineering, conditioning, and conformity.<br>
                <i>Security~</i> cryptography, network security, password cracking.<br>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <u>Some of my non-academic interests:</u><br>
                <i>Crochet~</i> I have been getting into crochet as a stress reliever, there is something so satisfying about
                physically making something<br>
                <i>Predator Catching~</i> For a couple years now, I have been keeping up with new software predator catchers have been using. 
                My favorite youtubers to watch (besides the infamous Chris Hansen of course) are 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PPSETX" target="_blank" title="The Predator Poachers">Alex Rosen</a>
                and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JiDion" target="_blank" title="JiDion">JiDion</a>.
                They talk sometimes about the software they use to track the metadata of images which is crazy cool.
                <br>
                <i>Art History~</i> Post-War era art + Byzantine art and architecture primarily
